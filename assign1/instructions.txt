For this assignment, you are to implement a basic List of String objects, backed by an array.  You should implement the attached interface (StringList).  I have attached a very basic JUnit test file to get you started.

Grading:

25 points: your file implements the specified interface and compiles.

6 points (1 point each): your file passes the grader's tests for the add(String), get, size, clear, set, and isEmpty methods.

2 points: your file passes the grader's tests for the contains method.

12 points (3 points each): your file passes the grader's tests for the toArray, add(int, String), indexOf, and remove methods.

5 points: style / implementation / grader's discretion.

Please submit a file called StringArrayList.java here by January 20 at noon (eastern standard time).  You do not need to submit a JUnit test file.
