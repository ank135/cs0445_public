# Assignment 2

For this assignment, you are to implement a basic List of String objects, backed by a linked list of StringNode objects.  I've created a skeleton class for you; you will need to implement the necessary methods.  You will also need to build a StringIterator and implement an iterator method. 

As the JUnit test is very similar to the last one, I've supplied a complete JUnit test for this assignment.

Grading:

25 points: your class implements the specified interface and compiles (it already does this, so if you literally just turn in the attached StringLinkedList.java file you can get half credit).

2 points: your class implements the add(String) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

2 points: your class implements the get(int) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

1 point: your class implements the contains(String) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

2 points: your class implements the indexOf(String) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

1 point: your class implements the size() operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

4 points: your class implements the add(int, String) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

1 point: your class implements the clear() operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

1 point: your class implements the isEmpty() operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

4 points: your class implements the remove(int) operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

1 point: your class implements the toArray() operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

4 points: your class implements the iterator() operation properly (i.e., passes the tests).

2 points: your class implements the set(int, String) operation property (i.e., passes the tests).

Please submit a file called StringLinkedList.java here by February 3 at noon (eastern standard time).  You do not need to submit a JUnit test file or the supplied Java interfaces.
